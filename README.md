# PhaseGrass_review  
```
Response to reviewers' points:

1) HapHiC for Sikem

What I did is the following:

# install HapHiC
git clone https://github.com/zengxiaofei/HapHiC.git
mamba env create -p /scratch/yutang/haphic --file HapHiC/conda_env/environment_py310.yml

# now test HapHiC with the unitig assembly of Sikem generated by Hifiasm
# create a folder for testing with haphic
mkdir haphic_utg

# copy Sikem hifiasm p_utg assembly to this folder
cp hifiasm_ctg/sikem.asm.p_utg.fasta haphic_utg/Sikem_utg.fasta
# this utg assembly was generated while I was doing PhaseGrass with below command
# hifiasm -o sikem.asm -t 60 -l0 -u 0 ../all_hifi.fastq.gz

```
